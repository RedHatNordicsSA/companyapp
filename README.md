# Supply chain security demo
A traditional software CI/CD pipeline which builds software and then ships it to a content delivery network.
Can be used to demonstrate breaches of security in the content delivery network by copying an evil RPM in a local repo or in the development process by switching the pipeline to use EvilPipeline instead of Jenkinsfile.
